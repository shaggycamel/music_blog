Hello, I'm Oliver (Fred) ðŸ™‚

My keen interest in live music was a catalyst towards starting this blog. For me, it is a means to remember all concerts I attend. 

I try to keep my music taste as broad as possible and aim to find something I admire/enjoy about every music genre. However, in saying that, like all humans I am bias, and, when not paying attention, find myself reverting back to Psychedelic Rock and avoiding Country. 

Enjoy my blog!
