I was a tad apprehensive going in as I thought UB40 might be past their live performance use-by-date, in addition [*Red Red Wine*](https://open.spotify.com/track/4uOKFydzAejjSFqYbv1XPt?si=dc34e64e48874d56) is really the only UB40 song I know.\n\nMy brother and I went halves on a hash biscuit just before entering the venue.\n\n### Band\n\nUB40 are an English reggae band which formed in 1978. For twenty-eight years the line-up of musicians remained stable, but in 2008 frontman Ali Campbell had a dispute with his brother Stephen Campbell (guitar). Ali and a few other members departed, but UB40 remain touring to this day.\n\nThe band consists of:\n\n-   Robin Brown - guitar, vocals\n\n-   Jimmy Brown - drums\n\n-   Earl Falconer - bass, vocals\n\n-   Norman Hassan - percussion, trombone, vocals\n\n-   Matt Doyle - lead vocals, guitar\n\n\\\nAccompanying touring musicians:\n\n-   Laurence Parry - trumpet, flugelhorn, trombone\n\n-   Martin Meredith - saxophone, keyboard\n\n-   Tony Mullings - keyboard\n\n-   Ian Thompson - saxophone\n\n### Bowl of Brooklands\n\nBowl of Brooklands is a natural amphitheatre with a lake in front of the stage, it boasts a capacity of around 15,000 people.\n\nThe atmosphere at the venue is extremely relaxed! It is a perfect venue for music such as reggae, world and acoustic. The family-friendly vibe means the age range of attendees is large.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<div id=\"htmlwidget-ccd984cb702c33c0c06b\" style=\"width:100%;height:464px;\" class=\"leaflet html-widget\"></div>\n<script type=\"application/json\" data-for=\"htmlwidget-ccd984cb702c33c0c06b\">{\"x\":{\"options\":{\"minZoom\":5,\"maxZoom\":17,\"crs\":{\"crsClass\":\"L.CRS.EPSG3857\",\"code\":null,\"proj4def\":null,\"projectedBounds\":null,\"options\":{}}},\"calls\":[{\"method\":\"addTiles\",\"args\":[\"https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png\",null,null,{\"minZoom\":0,\"maxZoom\":18,\"tileSize\":256,\"subdomains\":\"abc\",\"errorTileUrl\":\"\",\"tms\":false,\"noWrap\":false,\"zoomOffset\":0,\"zoomReverse\":false,\"opacity\":1,\"zIndex\":1,\"detectRetina\":false,\"attribution\":\"&copy; <a href=\\\"https://openstreetmap.org\\\">OpenStreetMap<\\/a> contributors, <a href=\\\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/\\\">CC-BY-SA<\\/a>\"}]},{\"method\":\"addMarkers\",\"args\":[-39.0680543624035,174.083408295001,null,null,null,{\"interactive\":true,\"draggable\":false,\"keyboard\":true,\"title\":\"\",\"alt\":\"\",\"zIndexOffset\":0,\"opacity\":1,\"riseOnHover\":false,\"riseOffset\":250},\"Bowl of Brooklands\",null,null,null,null,{\"interactive\":false,\"permanent\":false,\"direction\":\"auto\",\"opacity\":1,\"offset\":[0,0],\"textsize\":\"10px\",\"textOnly\":false,\"className\":\"\",\"sticky\":true},null]}],\"setView\":[[-39.0680543624035,174.083408295001],13,[]],\"limits\":{\"lat\":[-39.0680543624035,-39.0680543624035],\"lng\":[174.083408295001,174.083408295001]}},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}</script>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<br>\n\nVocals in the supporting act ([Jefferson Starship](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2qFr8w5sWUITRlzZ9kZotF?si=FJYTxdtnQsCEA6TXYox2sQ)) were a bit quiet at times, particularly Jude Gold's vocals, which was a shame because Jude is an incredible vocalist and still kicks arse at a mature age.\n\nHowever, UB40's sound drifted upwards throughout the amphitheatre entering one's senses like a full-bodied wine. It was a very rich and complete harmony of brass, string and percussion.\n\nBeer was \\$10 a can.\n\n### Performance\n\nFor the first 30 minutes or so, UB40 just jammed! The brass & bongo section really enhanced the flavour of the music, and they played like seasoned veterans who have outgrown merely playing songs to an audience.\n\nInstead, it *appeared* UB40 were able to walk on stage and play as if they were experimenting with some new tune, but made it sound polished and ready for listening consumption. - Quite incredible really.\n\nThe crowd was up and dancing, little children were running around and geriatrics were smoking joints, peace and love could be felt drifting with the music.\n\n### Thoughts\n\nUB40 exceeded my expectations, they have been around since 1978 and still can deliver an awesome and fun live performance.\n\nBowl of Brooklands is a fantastic venue, in this setting I felt UB40 were able to inspire a feeling of serenity to the audience. One could not have asked for a better combination of `band + venue`.\n\nAdmittedly, the hash brownie and copious amount of alcohol consumed assisted with my feelings of inner peace, but the gig also took place between Christmas and New Year so it's a period of time meant for spending with family and loved ones.\n\n### Final Rating\n\n-   Band: 4/5 (really good)\n\n-   Venue: 5/5 (amazing)\n\n-   Evening: 4/5 (really good)\n\n### Rating System\n\n1 (bad); 2 (not bad); 3 (good); 4 (really good); 5 (amazing)\n",
