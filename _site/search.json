    "text": "Band\nGroove Armada are an electronic music duo who were active around the late 90s / early 00s. They are within the bedrock of the British electronic music scene, amongst the likes of: Chemical Brothers, Massive Attack, The Prodigy…\nPerforming live they played with a full band, consisting of:\n\nAndy Cato (song-writer) – Bass, Trombone, Synth\nTom Findlay (song-writer) – Guitar, Synth\nMichael Anthony Daniels – MC\nunknown x – Vocals\nunknown y – Vocals\nunknown z – Drums\nunknown a – Synth\n\n\n\nTSB Arena\nTSB Arena is one of the biggest venues in Wellington with a capacity of around 5,000 people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSound was rock solid! There was never a moment where one instrument over powered another. Vocals, trombone, drums, bass, guitar and synth could all distinctly be heard, which is a challenge, particularly in large venues. Kudos to the sound-engineer/team.\nBeer was $10 a can.\n\n\nPerformance\nGroove Armada’s performance was energetic, all songs were performed with intent to move the crowd. Both female singers were powerful in their presence and vocals took centre stage in songs that had words.\nVocalists and the MC were able to lay down catchy vocal hooks propped up by a steady tempo the drums and bass kept. Bass was often drenched in distortion which created a wider/dirtier audio range for guitar and synth to stylise.\nMany times throughout the set drums took me by surprise. Timing was impeccable, and played with perfect dynamic control. Often, as the beat settled down, it blasted back into action jolting listeners attention.\nTrombone appeared on multiple tracks. The blunt, goofy tone of trombone swayed the audience, lulling goers into a relaxed yet awake state.\n\n\nThoughts\nGroove Armada attracted a vast demographic of listeners. This wide range of attendees made for a very peaceful crowd, people genuinely cared for others, and it was possible to feel a sense of well-being emanating from the crowd. The concert was also on a Sunday, so most concert-goers will have had work on Monday. This may been a factor towards the absence of drunken antics usually elicited from punters at large music events.\n\n\nFinal Rating\n\nBand: 4/5 (really good)\nVenue: 4/5 (really good)\nEvening: 3/5 (good) * low-scoring because hungover…\n\n\n\nRating System\n1 (bad); 2 (not bad); 3 (good); 4 (really good); 5 (amazing)"

    "text": "Band\nKhruangbin are a trio originating from Texas, USA. The word “khruangbin” means airplane in the Thai language, indicating the group’s quest to combine as many different worldly reputations into their sound as possible. I hear influence in their music from Thai, Spanish, Middle Eastern and African (William Onyeabor) sounds as well as heavy dominion from classic instrumental rock group The Shadows (Cliff Richards), giving the band their instantly recognizable and hauntingly psychedelic sound.\nThe band consists of:\n\nMark Speer – Guitar\nDonald Johnson (DJ) – Drums\nLaura (make me blush) Lee – Bass\n\n\n\nSpark Arena\nSpark Arena is one of the biggest music venues in New Zealand with a capacity of around 12,000 people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEcho from the supporting act’s bass drum was a little dominant. However, I think this was because Kamasi Washington (support) have two drummers which is not a conventional band configuration for sound engineers to master.\nConversely, Khruangbin’s sound reverberated vastly throughout Spark. Tone was clear, and discernible and seemed to travel endlessly, un-abrupted by any physical barriers. Perhaps this is a characteristic of Spark? – It suited Khruangbin’s music, so if the sound team mixed like this intentionally…ka pai!\nBeer was $10 - $12 a plastic cup.\n\n\nPerformance\nVerbal interaction with the crowd was minimal although Khruangbin communicated with the audience through their music. Songs seemed to sway/drift into one another, it was a continual music experience.\nDJ, on drums, is a human metronome. His beat keeping is undeterrable and he plays with such delicacy barely touching the snare, it’s almost as if he prefers all attention to be focused on Mark and Laura. Despite his unselfish musicianship and style of playing I noticed/admired his key contribution to Khruangbin. Plus, I dig his cowboy hat and poncho combination…makes me want to hug him.\nMark’s guitar tone is so sharp it could slice cheese. His solos and licks pierce through the bouncy and contrasting environment that Laura establishes on bass. He uses reverb exceptionally well, complimenting Laura’s floaty playing style. I feel Mark’s playing is used as an alternative to providing vocals on songs.\nLaura is so cool! She adds such flare and colour to the group. Her bass tone is blunt, punchy and bops along in a funky way that gives Khruangbin their fun sound. She accentuates her mid-low tone, perhaps assisted by flatwound as opposed to regular groundwound bass strings (am I right Laura? Call me…. please)\n\n\nThoughts\nI’m lost for words…Khruangbin were incredible!\nHalfway through the set Khruangbin remixed numerous well-known rap songs, syncing them with their songs, which took everyone by surprise. As surprising as it was, it didn’t feel out of place in that moment because Khruangbin played with such ambuscade.\nAfter completing the initial set Khruangbin performed for two more encores! – Very few bands feel compelled to bless the audience for two post-set performances. This was the last show of Khruangbin’s world tour, so maybe Khruangbin celebrated this fact by going out with a bang and playing one final hurrah.\nA sense of fun, playfulness and pure enjoyment could be felt amongst the dancing audience, it was a beautiful feeling. Overall the performance made for a fantastic evening, slight shame it was Tuesday and not a Saturday.\n\n\nFinal Rating\n\nBand: 5/5 (amazing)\nVenue: 5/5 (amazing)\nEvening: 5/5 (amazing)\n\n\n\nRating System\n1 (bad); 2 (not bad); 3 (good); 4 (really good); 5 (amazing)"

    "text": "Band\nJakob are from Hawkes Bay and have been part of the NZ music scene since the late 90’s/early 2000’s. The lineup is:\n\nJeff Boyle – guitar\nMaurice Beckett – bass\nJason Johnston – drums\n\n\n\nSan Fran\nFormerly called San Francisco Bath House, San Fran is situated on Cuba St, in the Wellington CBD. It is a medium sized venue with capacity of around 500 people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSound was clear, at no point throughout the show did one instrument drown-out or over power another. Perhaps the lack of vocals makes sound management somewhat simpler?\nBeer was around $13 a pint.\n\n\nPerformance\nJakob’s performance was calculated, precise and captivating. Drums and bass are extremely tight, Maurice (bass) and Jason (drums) feed off each-other laying down a rock solid tapestry for Jeff (guitar) to provide a swirling, reverberating style of guitar.\nMaurice uses bass delay and phaser pedals extremely well, creating a drone like ambiance. Jason lays down drum beats in strange and interesting time signatures. It’s clear all three members have been playing together for a very long time (25+ years).\n\n\nThoughts\nI witnessed shamanic art! - Jakob took the audience on a journey and everyone followed.\nTheir live performance is felt, rather than heard. During the show I found myself caught up within a bottemless introspective moment, absolutely lost at sea amongst the sound-waves. I could feel the whole audience caught in the same trance, Jakob had successfully cultivated a deep connection with the audience. I remember a feeling of spiritual enlightenment after the show, and enjoying how beautiful and blissful the enlightenment felt.\nJason’s tribal drum beats are mystifying, something about his playing makes me feel primal and simple, yet sophisticated and complex at the same time. The melodic drone layered on top of Jason’s beats by Jeff and Maurice creates a swilling soundscape where a wall of music emanates from, encapsulating everything within its wake and weaving all organisms into one single form of consciousness.\nIt was an amazing concert! - I can’t believe I hadn’t heard of Jakob earlier. I’m also really glad I took earplugs. Music was not unpleasantly loud, but the reverberating sound-waves would have potential to deafen one’s ears.\n\n\nFinal Rating\n\nBand: 4/5 (really good)\nVenue: 3/5 (good)\nEvening: 5/5 (amazing)\n\n\n\nRating System\n1 (bad); 2 (not bad); 3 (good); 4 (really good); 5 (amazing)"

    "text": "Band lineup\nHans Pucket consists of brothers Oliver and Callum Devlin (twins), John Nott and Callum Passels. They hail from Wellington so are playing to a home crowd tonight which contains friends and family.\n\nOliver – guitar, (main) vox\nCallum D – bass, vox\nJohn – drums, guitar, vox\nCallum P – keys, saxophone, guitar, vox, shaker, tambourine, more…...\n\n\n\nVogelmorn Hall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVogelmorn Hall is essentially a lawn bowls club with a small performance hall (capacity 120) located in Brooklyn, Wellington. This is a residential suburb, and the venue is surrounded by houses, which is different to the usual town-strip location for Wellington music venues. Walking into the hall I felt I was back in cub-scouts earning badges and learning how to make bird-boxes from micro-density-fibre.\nThe venue became a tad hot and stuffy, a bit of airflow would’ve made a difference. Throughout the show vocals were slightly unclear, but sound overall was lucid and could be felt in one’s bones.\nBeer at the venue was around $10 a can.\n\n\nPerformance\nStarting off, songs were not as poppy as I expected. They followed a strum + sing pattern with very smartly placed and interesting accents added throughout (shaker, tambourine, etc). I heard influence from Crowded House, although I also felt songs lacked a climax. Bear in mind, this is early in the set where the band is warming up, getting an idea of the atmosphere, and shaking any butterflies.\nThe second half of the set took on a more energetic persona, songs were catchy, poppy and chic. Hans Pucket had found their mojo and communicated well with the crowd, establishing a groovy atmosphere for the audience to vibe within. They performed with flair; it’s clear band members are in-sync with one another.\n\n\nThoughts\nOverall I thought the event went well! - The band put on a good performance, the venue was interesting and I left knowing I would see them again.\nHans Pucket pulled off dazzling vocal harmonies showcasing their talent to perform as a single organism. One whole, as opposed to four parts. I’m not entirely sure how songs progressed in terms of their chronological history, but by the end of the night the audience was moving, and a sense of excitement could be felt in the present moment. Tunes performed were catchy and I found myself singing along even though I had no idea of the words.\nI was particularly impressed with Callum Passels talent to jump between instruments. He has an amazing vision to accentuate sounds/dynamics, using an array of instruments, at precisely the right moment in a song. These instances add a flavourful spice to songs and I feel defines the groups sound-signature.\nHans Pucket are at the start of their career with an eventful future ahead. They are nurturing a sound that is uniquely theirs and will mark a stamp on the NZ music scene.\n\n\nFinal Rating\n\nBand: 3/5 (good)\nVenue: 2/5 (not bad)\nEvening: 4/5 (really good)\n\n\n\nRating System\n1 (bad); 2 (not bad); 3 (good); 4 (really good); 5 (amazing)"
