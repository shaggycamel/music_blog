### Evening

On Friday the 30<sup>th</sup> of December 2022, I saw [UB40](https://open.spotify.com/artist/69MEO1AADKg1IZrq2XLzo5?si=cvhud4KESe25rN7hd7nM_Q) perform at the Bowl of Brooklands located in New Plymouth, NZ.

Joining me at the concert was my mum, dad & brother. I was a tad apprehensive going in as I thought UB40 might be past their live performance use-by-date, in addition [*Red Red Wine*](https://open.spotify.com/track/4uOKFydzAejjSFqYbv1XPt?si=dc34e64e48874d56) is really the only UB40 song I know.

My brother and I went halves on a hash biscuit just before entering the venue.

### Band

UB40 are an English reggae band which formed in 1978. For twenty-eight years the line-up of musicians remained stable, but in 2008 frontman Ali Campbell had a dispute with his brother Stephen Campbell (guitar). Ali and a few other members departed, but UB40 remain touring to this day.

The band consists of:

-   Robin Brown - guitar, vocals

-   Jimmy Brown - drums

-   Earl Falconer - bass, vocals

-   Norman Hassan - percussion, trombone, vocals

-   Matt Doyle - lead vocals, guitar

\
Accompanying touring musicians:

-   Laurence Parry - trumpet, flugelhorn, trombone

-   Martin Meredith - saxophone, keyboard

-   Tony Mullings - keyboard

-   Ian Thompson - saxophone

### Bowl of Brooklands

Bowl of Brooklands is a natural amphitheatre with a lake in front of the stage, it boasts a capacity of around 15,000 people.

The atmosphere at the venue is extremely relaxed! It is a perfect venue for music such as reggae, world and acoustic. The family-friendly vibe means the age range of attendees is large.

Vocals in the supporting act ([Jefferson Starship](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2qFr8w5sWUITRlzZ9kZotF?si=FJYTxdtnQsCEA6TXYox2sQ)) were a bit quiet at times, particularly Jude Gold's vocals, which was a shame because Jude is an incredible vocalist and still kicks arse at a mature age.

However, UB40's sound drifted upwards throughout the amphitheatre entering one's senses like a full-bodied wine. It was a very rich and complete harmony of brass, string and percussion.

Beer was \$10 a can.

### Performance

For the first 30 minutes or so, UB40 just jammed! The brass & bongo section really enhanced the flavour of the music, and they played like seasoned veterans who have outgrown merely playing songs to an audience.

Instead, it *appeared* UB40 were able to walk on stage and play as if they were experimenting with some new tune, but made it sound polished and ready for listening consumption. - Quite incredible really.

The crowd was up and dancing, little children were running around and geriatrics were smoking joints, peace and love could be felt drifting with the music.

### Thoughts

UB40 exceeded my expectations, they have been around since 1978 and still can deliver an awesome and fun live performance.

Bowl of Brooklands is a fantastic venue, in this setting I felt UB40 were able to inspire a feeling of serenity to the audience. One could not have asked for a better combination of `band + venue`.

Admittedly, the hash brownie and copious amount of alcohol consumed assisted with my feelings of inner peace, but the gig also took place between Christmas and New Year so it's a period of time meant for spending with family and loved ones.

### Final Rating

-   Band: 4/5 (really good)

-   Venue: 5/5 (amazing)

-   Evening: 4/5 (really good)
